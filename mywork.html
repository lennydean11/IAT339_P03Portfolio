        <h3>pre-production | storyboard and concept</h3>
      <p>I came up with the idea of narrating my experience with the pandemic by documenting how I dealt with the tragic loss of my great grandmother back home and not being able to say goodbye to her. I thought that I could tell this story through my cousin by interviewing him and documenting both of our experiences in one narrative. I roughly had an idea of how the story would unfold and crafted a storyboard that would illustrate my intentions for this project. The first iteration of the storyboard had a bit of a direction but was missing an ending. With the story revolving primarily on an interview, I had to get my cousin’s view on his experience which helped me to come up with a better and concise storyboard.</p>

      <h3>production | shooting</h3>
      <p>With my cousin sharing the same household, I was the one able to conduct and film the interview. The filming stage took place on 2 different days as our rough cut footage had to be improved. With the COVID-19 restrictions, we had no access to decent equipment which gave me the opportunity to buy my own tripod. It was challenging to find decent light in the apartment which is also why we had to reshoot the interview during daylight. I improved my framing, mise-en-scene and shooting skills with acquired knowledge on how to get better slow motions by filming in 60fps.</p>

      <h3>post-production | adobe Premiere Pro</h3>
      <p>Having only been involved in post-production and production stages of projects before, I acquired new skills and knowledge in the post-production stage especially in Adobe Premiere Pro. The editing stage was the most challenging for me even if my storyboard helped a little bit, it was hard to assemble the footage in the most meaningful way, always telling to myself that this scene or that moment does not look good enough or as expected. Moreover, some footage were out of focus or had a lot of noise which led me to watch tutorials on how to fix those, with the video quality being hindered. I had the idea to record interviews by using earphones microphones hidden in the subject’s shirt to get better quality audio, which was really helpful in the sound design stage. It made the process smoother as I only had to adjust the volumes of the footage to make it consistent. </p>

        <h1>George</h1>
      <p>In Narrative & New Media class, our team was in charge of developing an narrative that would be displayed on a website that a user could interact with. I was involved in the early stages of the process for this project as I contributed in creating a meaningful story. I was mainly in charge of the storyboard and creating the graphics for the story as we decided that our story would have comic book-like visuals.</p>
      <p>Our story takes place in a small town called Sherwood where two long-time friends are on the verge of parting ways due to the current environmental situation of the town. George, who is secretly in love with Elizabeth tries to make her stay by taking action and pushing the people of Sherwood to save their town. With this project, we wanted to not only inform users about the environmental state of our planet but use the platform to make users interact with the story by making their own choices to influence the ending. The Website allowd us to have buttons which would guide users to different scenes depending on their choices. In order to achieve this, our team had to carefully think of our intentions while designing different scenarios that would convey different messages. On top of the illustrations, I had the task of creating one scenario of the 4 scenarios that would tak the story forward. </p>

      <h1>Harold's Toy</h1>
    <p>In SIAT's 3D Animation course, my team had to create a 3D animated short film based on an existing or an original story with the help of MAYA, a 3D Animation software. For this project, we had to carefully follow the different stages of creating a short film, that is, pre-production, production and post-production. I was in charge of the storyboard stage, where conceptual ideas turn into concrete ideas. I was also involved in modelling, rigging and animating different scenes.</p>
    <p>Characters are one of the most important elements of an animation film. In my sketches, I intend to portray the overall look and personality of the character that will be reflected in the final film. After designing the character, my duty was to illustrate how every scene, from the exposition stage to the resolution, would unfold. I try to incorporate as many emotions as possible, with a variety of shots, ranging from close-ups to long shots, to provide dynamism to the storyboard and the film. The main issues we encountered was time management. With a deadline to respect, every member's role was interchained. As a result, the team took decisions together which helped the project to not only be completed on time, but also have a uniform flow, which was reflected in the final piece.</p>
